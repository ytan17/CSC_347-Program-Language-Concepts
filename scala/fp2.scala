/* INSTRUCTIONS
 *
 * Complete the exercises below.  For each "EXERCISE" comment, add
 * code immediately below the comment.
 *
 * Please see README.md for instructions, including compilation and testing.
 * 
 * GRADING
 * 
 * 1. Submissions MUST compile using SBT with UNCHANGED configuration and tests with no
 *    compilation errors.  Submissions with compilation errors will receive 0 points.
 *    Note that refactoring the code will cause the tests to fail.
 *
 * 2. You MUST NOT edit the SBT configuration and tests.  Altering it in your submission will
 *    result in 0 points for this assignment.
 *
 * 3. You MUST NOT use while loops or (re)assignment to variables (you can use "val" declarations,
 *    but not "var" declarations).  You must use recursion instead.
 *
 * 4. You may declare auxiliary functions if you like.
 *
 * SUBMISSION
 *
 * 1. Push your local repository to the repository created for you on Bitbucket before the deadline.
 *
 * 2. Late submissions will not be permitted because solutions will be discussed in class.

  // EXERCISE 13: complete the definition of the following function that computes the length of

  // For example:
  // 
  //   stringLengths (List ("the", "rain")) == List (("the", 3), ("rain", 4))

  // EXERCISE 14: complete the function definition for "delete1" that takes
  // an element "x" and a list "ys", then returns the list where any

  // "delete1" MUST be recursive.

  // and not use recursion explicitly.

  // EXERCISE 17: complete the function definition for "removeDupes1" below.
  // It takes a list as argument, then returns the same list with
  // consecutive duplicate elements compacted to a single element.  
  // Duplicate elements that are separated by at least one distinct
  // element should be left alone.
  // EXAMPLE:
  // - removeDupes1 (List (1,1,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,6,7,7,8,9,2,2,2,9)) == List (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,2,9)
  def removeDupes1 [X] (xs:List[X]) : List[X] = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.

  }


  // EXERCISE 18: write a function "removeDupes2" that behaves like "removeDupes1",
  // but also includes a count of the number of consecutive duplicate
  // elements in the original list (thus producing a simple run-length
  // encoding).  The counts are paired with each element in the output
  // list.
  // EXAMPLE:
  // - removeDupes2 (List (1,1,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,6,7,7,8,9,2,2,2,9)) == List ((2,1),(1,2),(3,3),(2,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,7),(1,8),(1,9),(3,2),(1,9))

    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    null
  }


  // EXERCISE 19: complete the following definition of a function that splits a list
  // into a pair of two lists.  The offset for the the split position is given
  // by the Int argument.
  // The behavior is determined by:
  //
  //   for all n, xs:
  //     splitAt (n, xs) == (take (n, xs), drop (n, xs))   
  //
  // Your definition of "splitAt" must be recursive and must not use "take" or "drop".
  //
  // Your definition of "splitAt" must only travere the list once.  So
  // you cannot define your own versions of "take"/"drop" and use them
  // (because that would entail one traversal of the list with "take"
  // and then a second traversal with "drop").
  def splitAt [X] (n:Int, xs:List[X]) : (List[X], List[X]) = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    null
  }

  // EXERCISE 20: complete the following definition of an "allDistinct" function that checks
  // whether all values in list are distinct.  You should use your "member" function defined earlier.
  // Your implementation must be recursive.
  // EXAMPLE:
  // - allDistinct (Nil) == true
  // - allDistinct (List (1,2,3,4,5)) == true
  // - allDistinct (List (1,2,3,4,5,1)) == false
  // - allDistinct (List (1,2,3,2,4,5)) == false
  def allDistinct (xs : List[Int]) : Boolean = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    false
  }
